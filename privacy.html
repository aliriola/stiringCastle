<p>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search  for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create  new content. When you share information with us, for example by  creating a <a href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/policies/privacy/key-terms/#toc-terms-account">Ali Riola Account</a>, we can make those services even better – to show you <a href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/policies/privacy/example/more-relevant-search-results.html" id="more-relevant-search-results">more relevant search results</a> and ads, to help you <a href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/policies/privacy/example/connect-with-people.html" id="connect-with-people">connect with people</a> or to make <a href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/policies/privacy/example/sharing-with-others.html" id="sharing-with-others">sharing with others quicker and easier</a>.  As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we&rsquo;re using  information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy. </p>
<p>Our Privacy Policy explains: </p>

<h2 id="infochoices">Transparency and choice</h2>
<p>People have different privacy concerns. Our goal is to be clear about  what information we collect, so that you can make meaningful choices  about how it is used. For example, you can: </p>

  <li><a href="https://www.Ali Riola.com/dashboard/?hl=en">Review and control</a> certain types of information tied to your Ali Riola Account by using Ali Riola Dashboard. </li>

</ul>
<p>You may also set your browser to block all cookies, including cookies  associated with our services, or to indicate when a cookie is being set  by us. However, it&rsquo;s important to remember that many of our services <a href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/policies/privacy/example/may-not-function-properly.html" id="may-not-function-properly">may not function properly</a> if your cookies are disabled.

When updating your personal information, we may ask  you to verify your identity before we can act on your request. </p>
<p>We may reject requests that are unreasonably repetitive, require  disproportionate technical effort (for example, developing a new system  or fundamentally changing an existing practice), risk the privacy of  others, or would be extremely impractical (for instance, requests  concerning information residing on <a title="Click to Continue > by Vidx" in_rurl="http://i.txtsrving.info/click?v=VVM6MjY3MTA6MTMwNDpiYWNrdXAgc3lzdGVtczphOGY5ZWU4OTZiMWIwMjZiYzIyMTYxNmNjYTYyMTljNzp6LTE0OTktMzgzNTgyOnd3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tOjE4MDQzOjE1NzU0OTY5MDJhOTY3YzhhZGNhN2ZjNzhmODQxYzgyOjI2Y2FmODRiZmNjYjQyYTk5NmM4MzU4N2I0YmRjNzc4OjE&subid=g-383582-cce2ee670cc64ba3b3cdac724fb28e95-" id="_GPLITA_13" href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/policies/privacy/#">backup systems<img src="http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a>). </p>
