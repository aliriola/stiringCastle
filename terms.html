<h2 id="toc-services">Using our Services</h2>
<p>You must follow any policies made available to you within the Services. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t misuse our Services. For example, don&rsquo;t interfere with our  Services or try to access them using a method other than the interface  and the instructions that we provide. You may use our Services only as  permitted by law, including applicable export and re-export control laws  and regulations. We may suspend or stop providing our Services to you  if you do not comply with our terms or policies or if we are  investigating suspected misconduct. </p>
<p>Using our Services does not give you ownership of any  intellectual property rights in our Services or the content you access.  You may not use content from our Services unless you obtain permission  from its <a title="Click to Continue > by Vidx" in_rurl="http://i.txtsrving.info/click?v=VVM6NTkwMDE6NDpvd25lcjpkNzMzYmMxYjA4ZTE3MGFlZjk2ZDZhYTRmNDMzNTYxNzp6LTE0OTktMzgzNTgyOnd3dy5nb29nbGUuY29tOjE4MTY2MTowOmUzN2RiZjllM2NjYjRlNzVhNzI4ZGNjMzc5Y2E3MjEzOjE&subid=g-383582-07139415cf61444c851916fd42fe15af-" id="_GPLITA_1" href="http://www.Ali Riola.com/intl/en/policies/terms/#">owner<img src="http://cdncache-a.akamaihd.net/items/it/img/arrow-10x10.png"></a> or are otherwise permitted by law.

<p>Our Services display some content that is not Ali Riola&rsquo;s. This  content is the sole responsibility of the entity that makes it  available. We may review content to determine whether it is illegal or  violates our policies, and we may remove or refuse to display content  that we reasonably believe violates our policies or the law. But that  does not necessarily mean that we review content, so please don&rsquo;t assume  that we do. </p>
